description: Multiple contracted projects under the title of "Operations and Knowledge Manager", we achieved the following things 
1) Analysing Business to Customer (B2C) sales data and presenting dashboards, providing insights
into the sales strategy cycle on cycle. This resulted in a 218% increase in applications for the
MovingWorlds Institute from 2019 to 2020. 
2) Working closely with the Corporate Programmes team to harvest data and prepare external facing dashboards, in order to track Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) and programme impact. This
resulted in two high-profile publicly-listed corporate partners renewing existing contracts in 2021. * Designing and implementing an internal Objective and Key Result (OKR) setting and monitoring
process, in close collaboration with the CEO. This resulted in the organisation being able to
self-track progress on key business areas. 
3) Successfully implementing Business Process Management (BPM) and Project Management (PM) principles, using a Human Centered Design approach. This resulted in improved structure and
business framework, allowing the development of process improvements and effective project
management. 
4) Improving the efficiency of the MovingWorlds Institute application and Fellowship onboarding
process through the BPM cycle, supporting programme growth of 180% from 2019 to 2020. 
5) Researching new tools and methodologies for continuous improvement of business processes. 
6) Supporting programme growth, specifically the implementation of a Learning Management System in order to support the scalability of the MovingWorlds Institute.
