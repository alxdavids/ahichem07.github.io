description: Multiple contracted projects under the title of "Operations and Knowledge Manager", we achieved the following things: <ol><li> Analysing Business to Customer (B2C) sales data and presenting dashboards, providing insights into the sales strategy cycle on cycle. This resulted in a 218% increase in applications for the MovingWorlds Institute from 2019 to 2020. <li> Working closely with the Corporate Programmes team to harvest data and prepare external facing dashboards, in order to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIâ€™s) and programme impact. This resulted in two high-profile publicly-listed corporate partners renewing existing contracts in 2021. <li> Designing and implementing an internal Objective and Key Result (OKR) setting and monitoring process, in close collaboration with the CEO. This resulted in the organisation being able to self-track progress on key business areas. <li> Successfully implementing Business Process Management (BPM) and Project Management (PM) principles, using a Human Centered Design approach. This resulted in improved structure and business framework, allowing the development of process improvements and effective project management. <li> Improving the efficiency of the MovingWorlds Institute application and Fellowship onboarding process through the BPM cycle, supporting programme growth of 180% from 2019 to 2020. <li> Researching new tools and methodologies for continuous improvement of business processes. <li> Supporting programme growth, specifically the implementation of a Learning Management System in order to support the scalability of the MovingWorlds Institute. </ol>
